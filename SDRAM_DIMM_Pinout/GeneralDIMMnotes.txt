Strange: (?)
	One DIMM (PC100, 16x64) Has CS0 and CS2 tied together
	(How can this even function in a normal PC?!)
	(Backside, unpopulated shorts CS1 and CS3!)
	NOT COMPATIBLE WITH SDRAMTHING
	(Note: found a motherboard which also shorts these)

Strange: (?)
	One DIMM (16x64, 16 chips) uses ONLY CS0 and CS2
	despite two-sided (could be x4 chips?)
