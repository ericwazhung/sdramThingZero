THIS FILE copied from sdrfr/4.00ncf/NOTES/SDRAM_Pinout.txt
 And modified to show the current wiring... (a/o sT3.5-16)
THIS also pieced-together from the file [sdrfr.../]NOTES/PC133-128MB.txt
And again, stolen from sdramThing4.0-15 for sdramThingZero


Vss = GND
Vdd = 3V3

. = Data I/O (DQn)
^ = Address/Bank Address Input (An/BAn)
: = Clock Input (CKn)
* = Command/Control Input
# = Data Mask Input (DQMBn)
(n) = Not Connected and/or typically unused
<n> = Power/GND



NOTE: As-Implemented:
DQMB0, DQMB1, and DQMB4 are soldered-together
Likewise: CK0 and CK1 are also soldered-together

'51 indicates the associated output from the 74x51
OS indicates the associated output from a One-Shot...
Pins ending in, e.g. /---- or ----\
 indicate fed-back command/address DQs
Pins ending in, e.g. \---- or ----/
 indicate fed-back command/address pins
  NOTE: These are *also* connected to the microcontroller
   (A0-11, BA0-1, /RAS, /CAS, /WE = 17 directly-fed-back command/address
    pins)
The matching of a particular DQ (/----) with command/address pins (\----)
 doesn't really matter.
DQ_CSn 
 These are fed-back Chip-Select DQs, which go through the '51
 before being fed-back to the actual Chip-Select pins
 Again, which one goes where doesn't really matter (CS0, CS1R, CS1W)
 These are tied directly to the microcontroller, as well.

FREE-RUNNER:
 This consists of the lower-pinned half of the SDRAM DIMM
   (The left-side, when viewed upright from the front)
   (The top half of this drawing)
SIDE-KICK:
 This consists of the higher-pinned half of the SDRAM DIMM
   (The lower-half of this drawing)
There are 32 bits available to each half
 So far, the Side-Kick really only implements two
   LCD Red
   LCD Green
 Other DQ's on the side-kick HAVE been soldered-up to the uC
 But serve no purpose.
 They *could* be connected to the Terminal Block and used for sample/repeat
 (But not viewable on the LCD)
 Thus, the "Logic Analyzer" could easily sample/repeat up to 32 bits,
 simultaneously... when the DQMB pins are tied together)



v4:
This introduces the ability to modify the LCD's DVH/Blue signal *without*
modifying the LCD's clock or other Free-Running bits
By moving the DVH/Blue DQ to another chip, with a separate DQMB on DQM_DATA
For backwards-compatibility, DQMB5 can be connected via jumper to DQM_AC
v4.0 has it jumpered to DQM_DATA.

/WE0: Dunno why they put 0 at the end, like there are other /WE pins... no.
CB7:0 = ECC Check Bits (usually unused)

ODDITIES I've run across:
* CS0 and CS2 as well as CS1 and CS3 *tied together* on the DIMM
   (Bad news, no? Tying driver outputs together?)
* Groups of chips connected with different methods depending on the signal
   (E.G. 8 chips, four connected to CS0, four to CS2
	               four connected to CK0, four to CK1
	 				   NOT THE SAME FOUR... i.e. Two of those connected to CS0
	 				   are connected to CK0, while the other two are on CK1)
* Four chips not consecutive
	(E.G. 8 chips on the same side: bytes 0, 4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7)

 *    I would love to believe in a world where licensing shouldn't be

 *    send positive vibes--if not an email.
 *    A world where we wouldn't have to think about the potential

 *    1) Please do not change/remove this licensing info.
 *       (You can add notes *surrounding* it!)
 *    2) Please do not change/remove others' credit/licensing/copyright 
 *         info, where noted. 
 *    3) If you find yourself profiting from my work, or derivatives,
 *         thereof, please send me a beer, a trinket, or cash is always 
 *         handy as well.
 *         (Please be considerate. E.G. if you've reposted my work on a
 *          revenue-making (ad-based) website, please think of the
 *          years and years of hard work that went into this!)
 *    4) If you/your company *intend(s)* to profit from my work, 
 *         you must get my permission, first. 
 *    5) No permission is given for my work to be used in Military, NSA,
 *         or other creepy-ass purposes. No exceptions. And if there's 
 *         any question in your mind as to whether your project qualifies
 *         under this category, you must get my explicit permission.
 *
 *    The open-sourced project this originated from is ~98% the work of

 *    That includes the "commonCode" and makefiles.
 *    Thanks, of course, should be given to those who worked on the tools
 *    I've used: avr-dude, avr-gcc, gnu-make, vim, usb-tiny, and 
 *    I'm certain many others. 
 *    And, as well, to the countless coders who've taken time to post
 *    solutions to issues I couldn't solve, all over the internets.
 *
 *
 *    I'd love to hear of how this is being used, suggestions for
 *    improvements, etc!
