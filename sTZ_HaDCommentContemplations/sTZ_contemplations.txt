(Parity bits -> 40bits...?)
(Byte5, currently with free-runner, CS could be pin-popped for 48-bits)

TODO:
   Why is sT4.5 at HaD.io, but only 4.0 listed here...?!
   Which is the latest version of sdrfr...? 4.00ncf or 4.00ncf4?
      See 4.00ncf4/sdrfr.h for some notes... also ./makefile
      Do those experiments still need consideration?



CKE:
   Currently, it seems, CKE is ONLY used during sdrfr_init()
      It *is* used, there...
   Table 17 (?)
      "All other modes are reserved or invalid"
      "Power-Down occurs if CKE is registered LOW coincident with a NOP or
         COMMAND INHIBIT when no accesses are in progress"
         --Wasn't listed in the table...(?)
      "Power-Down is exitted by registering a NOP or COMMAND INHIBIT with
         CKE HIGH at the desired clock edge"
      "Power-Down deactivates the input and output buffers"
         Refresh times must be met (does not auto-refresh!)



IT SEEMS:
   CKE1/0 available at DIMM
      Yet, only 0 is used.......?
         (DIMM-specific?)
      Appears to be related to the number of "Rows" of 64-bit memory-groups
      Probably best to treat them the same... since most won't have two.


TRIGGERING:
   How to know when to *stop* sampling...?
      A) last 'page' doesn't jump back to the start... Free-Running stops
         Does Not allow for circular-buffering
            Relies on trigger-source accuracy...
               Trigger must occur starting at first-page
               (minor circular-buffer at the beginning?)
                  PAPAPAPAPAPA---overall-refresh
                  A couple bits indicate which page we're FR-looping in
                     Read-back prior to trigger
                        to know where to start read-back of pretrigger data
                  Override next FR-jump-address to linear (post-trigger)
                     pages... don't jump-back at the end of sampling.
      B) circular+timer-interrupt... kinda hokey, but not bad....
         Might need to track starting-page, again, would require more bits


PINS:
   Might need to read-back some address-bits 
      (e.g. circular pre-trigger)
      (FR-instruction write-verification...?)




IDEAS:
   Load one page
      replicate      Rue Mohr's comment
   Pulse-View software...?
