# YOU CAN IGNORE THIS FILE


# This file includes a block of code necessary for
# _commonCode vs. _commonCode_localized
# That particular block of code has to occur *before* any actual commonCode
# is included, and so therefore can't be in reallyCommon3.mk
# Nor can it be located inside _commonCode, because it determines *where*
# _commonCode is located.


# This is, roughly, what it used to look like in the project's 'makefile'
# which is just absurd to bombard a newbie with.



# THERE's REALLY NO REASON TO CHANGE THIS FILE...
# Though it may be informative.



#SKIP THIS BLOCK...
#   'till "### TO HERE ###"


#CENTRAL_COMDIR:
# THE FOLLOWING DEFINITIONS, THIS EXPLANATION, AND THE "###" BLOCK BELOW
# CAN BE IGNORED (But must be here)
#
# So here's an explanation:
#CENTRAL_COMDIR:
#Location of the centralized commonCode directory, relative to here...
#
# The contents of the _commonCode_localized directory, here, can be moved 
# to a centralized location 
# (e.g. CENTRAL_COMDIR="/home/you/_commonCode").
# Then each of your projects can use that same commonCode directory...
# E.G. Bug-fixes to _commonCode will then trickle-down to all your 
# projects.
#
# To do this, run 'make delocalize'
#
# Then, to later copy *from* the centralized _commonCode directory
#  back to _commonCode_localized:
#
# run 'make localize'
#
# CENTRAL_COMDIR should NOT be an absolute path... (nor '~')
#  Keep them it in this format.
# ALSO: CENTRAL_COMDIR should *not* end with '/'
#  OLDNOTE:
#  ...COMREL is used for compiling common-code locally (into _BUILD).
#  NOW (a/o reallyCommon3.mk++, heartbeat 2.05):
#  ...COMREL is extracted for that purpose FROM COMDIR
#     and no longer needs to be explicitly-defined
#
# UNTIL you plan to use a centralized _commonCode directory, you can
# just ignore this and the following "####" block.


# MY STRUCTURE:
# Projects are usually located in:
#   ~/_avrProjects/<projectName>/<projectVersion>
# And the central _commonCode directory is located at:
#   ~/_commonCode
# So, CENTRAL_COMDIR="../../../_commonCode" is where it's at.
#
# NOTABLE EXCEPTION:
# commonThings that have test-programs e.g.:
#  ~/_commonCode/heartbeat/2.05/testCombined/
# in which case, CENTRAL_COMDIR should be ../../../../_commonCode
# (note the additional '..')

# So we'll assume this is a normal project, and can override CENTRAL_COMDIR
# in the project's makefile as necessary...
ifndef CENTRAL_COMDIR
CENTRAL_COMDIR = ../../../_commonCode
endif

# This stuff has to be done early-on (e.g. before other makefiles are    #
#   included..                                                           #
