# adapter_khz 400 says falling back to non-bulk write, but:
#  BUG: register 'a0' not found

# A hacked version of openOCD-0.90 is installed, now...
#  It fast-writes *REALLY FAST*
# See MIPS_ETC/_PIC32_firstGo/openOCD/openOCD-0.90_hacked/
# (OR was it not actually flashing??? per heartbeatTest/4
#  reattempted -1, flickers again... definitely flashing...)

# It appears that nc keeps running until the exit command (in program) is

# So... I don't know, off-hand, how to use the same openocd session to
# *resume*...
