#Stolen from pic32_reset.sh and modified for an argument for PIC32
# device-selection...

# call: 'pic32_reset2.sh <device>' 
#  where <device> matches the MCU option in xc32-gcc, e.g.
#  '32MX170F256B' or '32MX230F064B' (dropping the 'PIC')



# This is taken almost directly from kinsamanka at github.com:

# His file was called pic32openocd

#TODO: I need to make sure to check his opensource licensing requests!


#TODO: Also need to look into making this device (not board) selectable...
#      e.g. via MCU...?
#      (currently I'm using a custom board.cfg)
