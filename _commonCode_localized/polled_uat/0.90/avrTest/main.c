/* mehPL:
 *    I would love to believe in a world where licensing shouldn't be
 *    necessary; where people would respect others' work and wishes, 
 *    and give credit where it's due. 
 *    A world where those who find people's work useful would at least 
 *    send positive vibes--if not an email.
 *    A world where we wouldn't have to think about the potential
 *    legal-loopholes that others may take advantage of.

 *
 *    This software and associated hardware design is free to use,
 *    modify, and even redistribute, etc. with only a few exceptions

 *    doesn't have to be):
 * 
 *    1) Please do not change/remove this licensing info.
 *       (You can add notes *surrounding* it!)
 *    2) Please do not change/remove others' credit/licensing/copyright 
 *         info, where noted. 
 *    3) If you find yourself profiting from my work, or derivatives,
 *         thereof, please send me a beer, a trinket, or cash is always 
 *         handy as well.
 *         (Please be considerate. E.G. if you've reposted my work on a
 *          revenue-making (ad-based) website, please think of the
 *          years and years of hard work that went into this!)
 *    4) If you/your company *intend(s)* to profit from my work, 
 *         you must get my permission, first. 
 *    5) No permission is given for my work to be used in Military, NSA,
 *         or other creepy-ass purposes. No exceptions. And if there's 
 *         any question in your mind as to whether your project qualifies
 *         under this category, you must get my explicit permission.
 *
 *    The open-sourced project this originated from is ~98% the work of

 *    That includes the "commonCode" and makefiles.
 *    Thanks, of course, should be given to those who worked on the tools
 *    I've used: avr-dude, avr-gcc, gnu-make, vim, usb-tiny, and 
 *    I'm certain many others. 
 *    And, as well, to the countless coders who've taken time to post
 *    solutions to issues I couldn't solve, all over the internets.
 *
 *
 *    I'd love to hear of how this is being used, suggestions for
