This appears to be very similar to the PC-based 'test'...
Not sure exactly what it's about...
But it doesn't work on Debian (Does 'test' anymore?)
test uses stdin_nonBlock
testPCLikePWM161 apparently tries to simulate spurradic puat_update() calls,
also, I think it tries to mimic some oddities of the PWM161, like doesn't it only have one timer, or something? That must be used by both tcnter AND the DMS timer...
Whatever the case, it's very specific, and not nearly as functional as 'test'
'test' has become 'testDesktop'
